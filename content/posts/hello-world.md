Welcome to my new blog! This is built with Hugo and the risotto theme.

## Markdown Test

Here are some **bold words** and some *italic text* to test formatting.

### Links and Lists

Check out my main site at [nate.green](https://nate.green).

Some things I'm working on:
- Building creative tools
- Research projects
- Musical endeavors
- Theater work

### Interactive Code Examples

Try running these code examples! Click the "Run" button to execute them.

**JavaScript Example:**
```javascript
console.log("Hello from JavaScript!");

// Try some calculations
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const sum = numbers.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
console.log(`Sum of ${numbers.join(', ')} = ${sum}`);

// Return a value
Math.PI * 2;
```

**Python Example:**
```python
print("Hello from Python!")

# Try some data manipulation
import math

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
total = sum(numbers)
print(f"Sum of {numbers} = {total}")

# Calculate something interesting
result = math.sqrt(16) + math.pi
print(f"√16 + π = {result:.3f}")

# Return the result
result
```

> This is a blockquote to test quote styling.

All rendered in beautiful monospace font with interactive execution!
